# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Deployment Instructions

Your project is now ready for Vercel deployment! All build errors have been fixed.

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

If you haven't already, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add backend form submission handlers with MongoDB and Cloudinary integration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (automatic)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (automatic)

#### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

**CRITICAL**: You must add your environment variables in Vercel!

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Add the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://tuskey054_db_user:7cN5rMGa5vbBTmI1@cluster0.z5mppuc.mongodb.net/darkhanwomen?retryWrites=true&w=majority
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

3. After adding variables, **redeploy** your project for them to take effect

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test your forms:
- Contact form: `https://your-project.vercel.app/contact`
- Donation form: `https://your-project.vercel.app/donate`
- Registration form: `https://your-project.vercel.app/register`
- Volunteer application: `https://your-project.vercel.app/volunteer/apply`
- Partner application: `https://your-project.vercel.app/partner/apply`

## Build Status

‚úÖ Build successful - no errors
‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings present but non-blocking
- Image optimization warnings (can be ignored or fixed later)
- Unused import warnings (cosmetic only)

## What Was Fixed

1. ‚úÖ All `any` types replaced with proper TypeScript types
2. ‚úÖ Error handling updated to use `unknown` and type guards
3. ‚úÖ Unused imports removed
4. ‚úÖ Next.js config file created
5. ‚úÖ All API routes properly typed
6. ‚úÖ All form integrations working

## Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- [ ] MONGODB_URI
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
- [ ] CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

## Deployment Notes

- MongoDB connection is cached for serverless environments
- All API routes are serverless functions (∆í symbol in build)
- Static pages are pre-rendered (‚óè symbol in build)
- File uploads work with Cloudinary
- Forms submit to MongoDB database

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed
- Check that all environment variables are set
- Verify MongoDB URI is correct
- Ensure Cloudinary credentials are valid

### Forms Not Working
- Verify environment variables in Vercel
- Check MongoDB database access
- Verify Cloudinary setup
- Check browser console for errors

### API Route Errors
- Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
- Verify MongoDB connection string
- Ensure IP whitelist includes Vercel IPs

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
2. Configure Cloudinary security settings
3. Test all forms on production
4. Set up monitoring/analytics
5. Consider adding email notifications
